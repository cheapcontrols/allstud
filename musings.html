			<h2>THE INDEPENDENT MIND</h2>
				<h3>The left thought freedom was the way</h3>
				<h3>But now they have begun to stray</h3>
				<h3>Now their feelings are all that matter</h3>
				<h3>Agree with them or life will splatter</h3>
				<br/>
				<h3>The right once wanted belief as law</h3>
				<h3>It appears they figured out their flaw</h3>
				<h3>Now they speak of your free speech</h3>
				<h3>Watch out they may begin to preach</h3>
				<br/>
				<h3>It appears the sides have flipped their view</h3>
				<h3>Donâ€™t trust the words they talk and spew</h3>
				<h3>Power is their deep desire</h3>
				<h3>Should we listen to a liar</h3>
