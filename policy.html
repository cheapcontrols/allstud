			<h2>TAXATION</h2>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs your hunky president, I will end all federal taxation.  
				I feel that the consensus in American is a dislike of taxation and I want to be the 
				President of all Americans.  This should appeal to everyone regardless of party.  
				The Right side of the aisle thinks taxes are too high on the rich so this should 
				make them happy.  The Left side thinks the middle class needs a tax break, this 
				should make them happy.  Neither side cares about the deficit so we can just keep 
				printing money and paying for everything with debt.  The Libertarians care about 
				the debt but they also think taxation is theft so who knows how they will react.  
				What a bunch of wackos.</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOver the next 10 years, we will reduce the amount allocated
				to every program by 10 percent until every program is eliminated.  If a politician 
				wants to keep a program running they will need to ask that constituents give of their 
				own free-will.  This will give both parties a chance to put their money where their 
				mouth is.  Warren Buffett and Bill Gates both say the rich should pay more in taxes.  
				Well, I say there is nothing stopping them from sending in some money.   On a side 
				note, this includes the politicians' salaries.  Yes, even mine as president.  I am 
				not worried, I know the ladies will make it rain.</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI think it is wrong to be in debt.  I will set up a Federal 
				lottery to pay off the debt.  My image will be on all the lottery tickets.  That way 
				even if you lose you can keep my picture and feel like a winner.  The ladies know what 
				I mean.  If there is one thing I know about the American people,  they love a chance at 
				a quick buck.  We could run it like a 50/50 drawing at a high school football game.  Is 
				it no wonder that I was the stud of the football team back in High School?  Don’t forget 
				to keep those notes of encouragement coming to hunkyman@allstud.net.</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs for the individual states.  They can do what they want.  
				Remember, this is a Republic.</p>
			<h2>Military</h2><h3>(credit to Dr. Beakmans 80-year-old Grandmother)</h3>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI figure if we can send the military into a country we can pull
				them out.  People are free to do as they wish in America.  If you want to go to another 
				country and join their military to help out, by all means, head on over.  If you want to 
				send aid to a country with starving babies then, by all means, send over a check.  We have 
				enough problems right here in this great country.  We don’t need to be all over the place 
				<q>Fixing</q> other places problems.  It is amazing how the moral right wing of this 
				country is fine sending our brave men and women into battle, racking up enormous debt 
				and getting horrible results all the while criticizing the left about the public school 
				system.  Don’t get me wrong the left is a bunch of self-righteous losers just trying to 
				make themselves look righteous all the while destroying lives of people they will never meet.  
				The self-righteous left continues putting up those stupid smug signs in their yards, all in 
				an effort to feel superior.  It is my opinion anything the government touches fails spectacularly.
			</p>
			<h2>Health Care</h2>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhy should we as Americans be forced to take insurance from our employers?  
				You should have the right to take what employers spend on your healthcare and by something hunky if 
				you want.  Camaro, anyone.  As your hunky president, I will make it illegal for employers to provide 
				health insurance.  They can pay for it but not provide it.  That way if you stupid non-risk takers 
				decide to put employer funds towards health insurance you will know how much it costs and if you 
				quit your stupid job you will be able to keep your insurance or better yet pay your Camero payment.
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy next step is with these blood-sucking insurance companies.  I got 
				dropped once just because they found out I like to drink gravy directly from the bowl.  The KFC 
				colonel sure knows how to cook.  They said it was blood pressure or cholesterol or some other 
				nonsense but I said <q>hold on there bucko</q>.  This insurance thing is just a big gamble.  I 
				give them money in anticipation of collecting back more than I paid in and they take my money in 
				anticipation of paying less out.  They can’t just decide not to pay when I win.  As long as you 
				make your payments I will make it illegal for insurance companies to drop your poorly maintained body.
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe next thing is they try to stick it to you as you get older.  This is 
				the biggest, lamest, most lowdown move yet.  When I sign up for insurance they know what I will probably 
				run-up in medical bills over my estimated lifetime.  They just need to factor that in and then charge 
				me monthly based on that rate.  My booky knows how to figure a vig so should these supposed fancy pants 
				insurance agencies.  I will make the spineless insurance agents work a little harder and as long as you 
				keep up your payments they will never be able to raise your rates.  What do you think would happen in 
				Vegas if they started saying no to people that win too much.
			</p>
			<h2>Climate Change</h2>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs your future Hunky president, I think we should leave the environment alone. 
				I believe we as humans are probably the worst thing to happen to this planet but, it will probably kill 
				us long before we kill it.  I will veto any subsidy that goes to anything.  These big company executives 
				that think they can steal from the pockets of my constituents can strap themselves to a wind turbine and 
				blow away.  Better yet I might sick Sarah Jean on them.  That would be a site.  She would be going back 
				and forth between big money greed and climate change.  Her head might just explode.
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspJust so you know that I would be not only hunky but fair.  I would stop any 
				subsidies currently being paid to big oil or any industry that is getting free money.  Why should a guy 
				or gal employed at the Piggly Wiggly pay for someone else employed at a gas refinery?  If nothing else 
				I will make the world a little simpler.  If I could get a few blood-sucking lawyers on the bread lines 
				I will consider myself a successful president.
			</p>
			<h2>Foreign Aid</h2>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI don’t understand foreign aid at this point in this crazy country.  
				I can’t believe that we are still going over to China and borrowing money that we will probably never 
				payback.  We take the money and then hand it over to another country that will never pay us back.  
				Sounds like it is China that is giving aid to foreign countries, not us.  As your most Hunky President, 
				I would never ask another country to be generous in our name.  We are America,  and we are prideful people.  
				If we want to help another country or our neighbors within this country we should donate with 
				voluntary donations.
